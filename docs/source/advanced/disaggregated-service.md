# Disaggregated-Service (experimental)


```{note}
Note:
This feature is currently experimental, and the related API is subjected to change in future versions.
```

Currently TRT-LLM supports `disaggregated-service`, where the context and generation phases of a request can run on different executors. TRT-LLM's disaggregated service relies on the executor API, please make sure to read the [executor page](executor.md) before reading the document.

For more information on disaggregated service in LLM inference, one can refer to papers such as [DistServe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09670), [SplitWise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18677).


## Usage

```cpp
enum class RequestType
{
    REQUEST_TYPE_CONTEXT_AND_GENERATION = 0,
    REQUEST_TYPE_CONTEXT_ONLY = 1,
    REQUEST_TYPE_GENERATION_ONLY = 2
};
```
The TRT-LLM executor can execute three types of requests: `REQUEST_TYPE_CONTEXT_AND_GENERATION`, `REQUEST_TYPE_CONTEXT_ONLY`, and `REQUEST_TYPE_GENERATION_ONLY`. An executor instance could execute the context phase of the context-only request or the generation phase of the generation-only request. When the executor completes the context phase of a context-only request, it maintains the corresponding KV cache, which will be requested by the executor for the subsequent generation-only request.


The TRT-LLM executor requires the configuration of CacheTransceiverConfig to enable disaggregated service. The constructor signature is defined as follows:
```cpp
CacheTransceiverConfig(bool enableCacheTransceiver,
        std::optional<CommType> commType, std::optional<size_t> maxNumTokens);
```
The configuration parameters serve the following purposes:
The `enableCacheTransceiver` parameter must be set to `True` to enable kvCache transfer functionality
The `commType` parameter determines the communication backend for kvCache transfer. Valid options include `CommType::UCX`, `CommType::NIXL`, and `CommType::MPI`, with `UCX` serving as the default backend
The `maxNumTokens` parameter specifies the buffer size for kvCache transfers. For optimal performance, this value should be set to match or exceed the maximum Input Sequence Length (ISL) of all requests.


Here are some key APIs to use disaggregated service:
```cpp
ExecutorConfig executorConfig{...};

executorConfig.setCacheTransceiverConfig(texec::CacheTransceiverConfig(true));

Request request{...};

request.setRequestType(tensorrt_llm::executor::RequestType::REQUEST_TYPE_CONTEXT_ONLY);

auto contextRequestId = contextExecutor.enqueueRequest(request);

auto contextResponses = contextExecutor.awaitResponses(contextRequestId);

auto contextPhaseParams = contextResponses.back().getResult().contextPhaseParams.value();

request.setContextPhaseParams(contextPhaseParams);

request.setRequestType(tensorrt_llm::executor::RequestType::REQUEST_TYPE_GENERATION_ONLY);

auto generationRequestId = generationExecutor.enqueueRequest(request);

auto genResponses = generationExecutor.awaitResponses(generationRequestId);

```

The generationExecutor will require data such as KV cache from the corresponding contextExecutor based on the `contextPhaseParams` attached to the request, so please make sure that the corresponding contextExecutor is not shut down before getting the generationExecutor's response.

In the code example above, the `contextRequestId` assigned by the contextExecutor and the `generationRequestId` assigned by the generationExecutor are independent, it is the user's responsibility to manage the mapping of the `requestId` for context-only requests to the `requestId` for generation-only requests. The `contextResponses` contains the first output token generated by the context phase, and the `genResponses` also contains the first output token generated by the contextExecutor,  so all output tokens can be obtained from generationExecutor's responses.


![disaggregated-service usage](images/disaggregated-service_usage.png)

An `orchestrator` is required in `disaggregated-service` to manage multiple executor instances and route requests to different executors, TRT-LLM provides class `DisaggExecutorOrchestrator` in `cpp/include/tensorrt_llm/executor/disaggServerUtil.h` to launch multiple executor instances, however, `DisaggExecutorOrchestrator` only routes requests to executors in a simple round-robin policy, users need to implement their own orchestrator for disaggregated-service based on their usage scenario.


## Example

Please refer to `examples/cpp/executor/executorExampleDisaggregated.cpp`

## Benchmarks

Please refer to `benchmarks/cpp/disaggServerBenchmark.cpp` and `benchmarks/cpp/README.md`

## Environment Variables

TRT-LLM uses some environment variables to control the behavior of disaggregated service.

* `TRTLLM_USE_MPI_KVCACHE`: Whether to use MPI to transfer KV cache. Currently, the default value is `0`.

* `TRTLLM_USE_UCX_KVCACHE`: Whether to use UCX to transfer KV cache. Currently, the default value is `0`.

* `TRTLLM_USE_NIXL_KVCACHE`: whether to use NIXL to transfer KV cache. Currently, the default value is `0`.
For disaggregated service functionality, the `enableCacheTransceiver` parameter in `CacheTransceiverConfig` must be set to `true`. If the `commType` parameter is not explicitly specified, TRT-LLM automatically determines the appropriate communication backend based on available environment variables.

* `TRTLLM_PARALLEL_CACHE_SEND`: If set to `1`, contextExecutor will attempt to send KV cache for multiple requests in parallel. The default value is `0`.

* `TRTLLM_DISABLE_KV_CACHE_TRANSFER_OVERLAP`: If set to `1`, generationExecutor will not overlap KV cache transfer with model inference. The default value is `0`.

* `TRTLLM_ENABLE_KVCACHE_RECEIVE_PARALLEL`:  When the generation rank receives KV cache from multiple context ranks within a single context instance, it will receive KV cache from each rank sequentially. If set to `1`, the generation rank will receive KV cache from each rank within one context instance in parallel. The default value is `0`.

* `TRTLLM_REQUEST_KV_CACHE_CONCURRENT`: If set to `1`, generationExecutor prepares independent resources for each context executor to receive KV cache, requests whose KV cache are received from different context executors will be processed concurrently. If set to `0`, the generation executor will reuse the same resource to process KV cache transfer for each request sequentially, reducing the resources used by KV cache transmission and thereby lowering the risk of running out of memory. The default value is `0`.

* `TRTLLM_TRY_ZCOPY_FOR_KVCACHE_TRANSFER`: TRT-LLM typically copies non-contiguous data into a temporary buffer before sending KV cache. If set to `1`, TRT-LLM will attempt to directly transmit each KV cache block, eliminating extra copies. The default value is `0`.

* `TRTLLM_KVCACHE_TRANSFER_BUFFER_SIZE`: By default, TRT-LLM uses a `stream-ordered memory allocator` to allocate temporary buffers. If this environment variable is set to #Size, TRT-LLM will use `cudaMalloc` to allocate buffer of size #Size for KV cache transmission. The default value is `512MB`. Users can set `TRTLLM_KVCACHE_TRANSFER_BUFFER_SIZE=1GB` to allocate a 1 GB buffer with `cudaMalloc` for KV cache transmission.

* `TRTLLM_KVCACHE_TRANSFER_USE_ASYNC_BUFFER`: If set to `1`, TRT-LLM will use `cudaMallocAsync` to allocate buffers for KV cache transmission. The default value is `0`. This environment variable only takes effect when `TRTLLM_KVCACHE_TRANSFER_BUFFER_SIZE` is greater than 0.

* `TRTLLM_KVCACHE_SEND_MAX_CONCURRENCY_NUM`: The maximum number of concurrent KV cache sends. The default value is `4`. This environment variable only takes effect when `TRTLLM_KVCACHE_TRANSFER_BUFFER_SIZE` is greater than 0.


## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### General FAQs

*Q. What are the limitations of disaggregated-service in TRT-LLM?*

A. Currently, only `decoder-only engine` and `beamWidth=1` are supported, and the KV cache at each layer of the model is required to be homogeneous, with the same data type and the same number of attention headers.

*Q. Is the engine used by disaggregated-service different from other engines?*

A. No. There are no special requirements for the arguments to build engine.

*Q. Do the engines used by the context executor and generation executor need to be the same?*

A. No. The engines used by context executor and generation executor can be different, and their parallelism can be heterogeneous, i.e., TP,PP can be different, and TRT-LLM will handle the heterogeneity of KV cache.

*Q. Does TRT-LLM support running multiple context executor instances and generation executor instances?*

A. Yes. TRT-LLM supports running multiple context executors and generation executors at the same time, and each executor can use different engine, but it is the user's responsibility to route requests to different executors and  manage `requestId`.

*Q. Can an executor handle both context-only requests and generation-only requests?*

A. Yes, but it's not recommended, TRT-LLM does not implement proper scheduling for the case where the executor handles mixed context-only requests and generation-only requests, it's better to run context-only requests and generation-only requests on different executors.

*Q. Does disaggregated-service in TRT-LLM support multi-gpu and multi-node?*

A. Yes, it's recommended that different executor use different GPUs . We support context-only executor and genertion-only executor run on same node or different nodes. The `participantIds` and `deviceIds` used by each executor need to be explicitly set by the user, and the `participantIds` of each executor must not be intersecting.

*Q. What's the requirement for disaggregated-service in TRT-LLM?*

A. TRT-LLM requires `UCX`-backend `CUDA-aware MPI` currently, TRT-LLM implements KV cache transfer with [`CUDA-aware MPI`](https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/v5.0.x/tuning-apps/networking/cuda.html#how-do-i-build-open-mpi-with-cuda-aware-support), and will support more communication components for KV cache transfer in future version.

### Debugging FAQs

*Q. How to handle error `Disaggregated serving is not enabled, please check the configuration?`*

A. please set `enableCacheTransceiver` of `CacheTransceiverConfig` as `true`.
```cpp
ExecutorConfig executorConfig{...};

executorConfig.setCacheTransceiverConfig(texec::CacheTransceiverConfig(true));
```

When the environment variable `TRTLLM_USE_MPI_KVCACHE=1` is set, TRT-LLM will transfer the KV cache using `CUDA-aware MPI`. All executor processes involved must share the same MPI world communicator. Consequently, with `TRTLLM_USE_MPI_KVCACHE=1`, TRT-LLM only supports launching multiple executors via `MPI`. Additionally, the `CommunicationMode` for the executors must be set to `kLEADER` or `kORCHESTRATOR` with `SpawnProcesses=false` for the `disaggregated-service`. These restrictions do not apply when `TRTLLM_USE_UCX_KVCACHE=1` is set.

*Q. Does TRT-LLM support using GPU direct RDMA for inter-node KV Cache transfer?*

A. Yes, TRT-LLM supports using GPU direct RDMA for inter-node KV cache transfer.

*Q. What causes the substantial bandwidth fluctuations in kvCache transfers, especially during the first few requests following service initialization?*

A. The communication for kvCache transfer between executors are established dynamically. The connection establishment process incurs significant overhead, which explains the apparently lower kvCache transfer bandwidth observed during the initial requests after service startup. This lower bandwidth reflects the inclusion of connection establishment overhead. When conducting benchmarks, it is recommended to perform a warm-up phase to ensure accurate performance measurements.
